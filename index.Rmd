I am a data analyst currently looking for new opportunities, after 8 years in the wine industry where I developed code-based solutions and fell in love with python and programming. I live in France but I am able to move anywhere around the ðŸŒŽ. I love working with data, sorting it, turning it around, creating ðŸ“ˆ, making it speak. I also enjoy cooking, hiking, travelling and gardening. Check up my portfolio and my work, and contact me for more information!
