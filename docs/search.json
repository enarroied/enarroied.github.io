I really found it fun since I love messing with data\nand turning it around to make it ‚Äúspeak‚Äù (I was already a huge fan of\nexcel pivot tables). The more I learn about data science the more I like\nit.\nI am a problem solver, looking for an opportunity to demonstrate my\nskills with a team of highly motivated and talented professionals, with\na start up spirit, and help contribute to the development of\ntechnology.\nYou can find more about how I created this portfolio in the blog post I created about\nit.\n\n\n\n",
