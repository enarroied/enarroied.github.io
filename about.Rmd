  Some additional details about me

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

I started learning programming because I was interested in automating some tasks at work. I really found it fun since I love messing with data and turning it around to make it “speak” (I was already a huge fan of excel pivot tables). The more I learn about data science the more I like it.

I am a problem solver, looking for an opportunity to demonstrate my skills with a team of highly motivated and talented professionals, with a start up spirit, and help contribute to the development of technology.

You can find more about how I created this portfolio in [the blog post I created about it](posts/welcome/index.html).
